Dart Backbone
==================

This is a base Backbone Application which consumes a dart sub-module

npm install

You will need to also fetch the latest of the sub module to run this

so remember to do:

git submodule foreach git pull origin master

This will pull all the latest submodules down.


```
grunt devserver
```
